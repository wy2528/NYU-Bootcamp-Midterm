## Introduction:
We are exploring how housing affordability and property characteristics vary across New York City properties. Our goal is to understand which areas are experiencing the fastest growth, how specific property features affect prices, and how proximity to amenities influences property values. Using publicly available datasets, our analysis compares property-level housing data to identify key patterns and trends in the NYC real estate market.

## Part I: Trends in Home Value Growth Across New York City Neighborhoods

The first question of our project addresses the basic question: which neighborhood has seen the most dramatic changes in home prices? From the CSV file obtained from Zillow, it lays out neighborhoods in the country and its average home values each month of the year. To focus on neighborhoods solely in New York City, we filtered out the data so that it only displays information from New York City. 

From there, we worked with the information to organize it into comprehensive tables and graphs to see the changes happening every year. The first visualization is a table, organized in descending order, showing which neighborhood has the highest percentage change from 2000 to 2025. Red Hook has an astonishing change of 1087.056%. This indicates that housing values have increased largely in that area, and that the houses in 2000 would be around 10 times more expensive if they were to buy it in 2025. Red Hook is around 250 percent higher than the second neighborhood with the highest percentage change in home value (Greenpoint at 827.34%), depicting its remarkable growth. 

For those who want to buy a house in a specific county, it is easier to identify which neighborhoods are in each county by grouping it together by county. We have also organized this table to be in descending order so that buyers can see which county has the highest percentage changes and within these counties, which specific neighborhood has the highest changes. The previous table has shown that Red Hook has the highest percentage change, but this table helps identify that Red Hook falls in Kings County. The trend depicts that Kings County overall has seen the highest growth in home values, with the top four neighborhoods with highest percentage change in home values all belonging to Kings County (Red Hook, Greenpoint, Clinton Hill, Bedford-Stuyvesant), which could convince some to buy or invest in that area.

The next two graphs aim to present the overall trend in New York City. We made a table depicting the average home prices in New York City, and beside it is the growth or decline in prices from the previous year. This enables us to see which years were profitable and when the housing market was doing its best. For instance, from 2007 to 2011, we see the percentage change is in the negatives, conveying that the house prices were declining and the housing market wasn't doing its best during those years. This might lead someone to hold off selling their house until these percentages go back into the positive. On the other hand in 2014 and 2022, we see a high percentage, with a 8.59% and 7.43% growth from the previous year. The table helps outline the specific values and changes.

The graph titled “Average Home Price Per Year in NYC Neighborhoods” shows the actual average price of homes across all New York neighborhoods for each year in the dataset. The overall trend of home values, including periods of increase and decrease, and the approximate price range are all illustrated on the graph. Conclusively, although not steady, the graph shows an upward trend of home prices in NYC, meaning that house prices have gotten more expensive over the years.

The graph titled “Average Home Price Change Per Year in NYC Neighborhoods” shows the percentage change in the average home price from the previous year. This highlights the rate of growth or decline. This graph is useful for understanding the volatility and speed of market changes. This graph serves as a visual representation of the earlier table, showing the percentage changes in house prices from the previous year. Supporting the earlier analysis from the table, we see a declining trend from 2007 to 2011, proving that the house price trend was overall declining. On a bigger scale, the graph depicts that house prices change yearly, but overall haven't grown dramatically from 2015 to now.

## Part II: Property Characteristics and Average Sale Prices

This part of the project concentrates on how property features impact the average sale prices for properties in New York City. By examining characteristics like building type, number of residential units, and gross square footage, we can determine whether these features affect prices and to what extent.

Using the CSV file acquired using GitHub, we can explore these specific features and property sales in New York City. We started by examining the relationship between the number of residential units and the sale price, categorizing the number of residential units into broader ranges. The graph shows that buildings with 0 residential units have the highest average sale price, followed by buildings with 50+ residential units. Buildings with 4-10 residential units have the lowest average sale price, costing nearly ⅙ of the amount of buildings with 0 residential units.
Next, we examined the relationship between a building’s gross square footage and its average sale price. We utilized a scattergram to represent a sample of this data. According to the results, most data points were relatively similar despite varying in gross square footage. While some data points represent a positive relationship between the two variables, as they show that buildings with a smaller gross square footage have a lower average sale price, the rest of the data do not show a clear relationship between a building's gross square footage and sale price.
To explore how building types influence a property’s average sale price, we utilized a bar graph. The results show that the average sale price is greatest for luxury hotels, followed shortly by condo office buildings and transportation facilities. However, because there are so many various building types in NYC, this graph can be difficult to read, especially when examining which building type has the lowest average sale price. We then grouped the building type into broader categories of condo, residential, and commercial/other buildings. This graph better presents the results that the average sale price is greatest for commercial buildings and lowest for residential buildings. Similar to buildings with 0 residential units, we can attribute this difference in cost to these buildings being primarily designed for businesses, which require other finishing standards than those of condo and residential buildings.
We then combined all the features in a scatterplot using a sample of the data to examine how all these characteristics factor into a property’s sale price. The results show that residential buildings with 0 residential units and smaller gross square footage are similarly priced with residential buildings with 50+ residential units and greater gross square footage. It also shows a positive relationship between the building's gross square footage and number of residential units, with the buildings with 0 residential units having a lower gross square footage, and buildings with 50+ residential units having a greater gross square footage. 


## Part III: Proximity to Amenities and Property Prices

This section of the project focuses on understanding how proximity to amenities, specifically subway stations and parks, affects property prices across New York City. The goal was to see whether being closer to a subway or a park is associated with higher home values and to explore how the type of park (waterfront vs. non-waterfront) influences prices. This section uses three datasets from NYC Open Data: NYC property sales (a sample of 500 properties), NYC subway station locations, and NYC parks.

We started by examining the relationship between property prices and distance to the nearest subway station. Using the NYC property sales dataset combined with subway locations, we calculated the distance from each property to the closest station. We then calculated the correlation coefficient between proximity to subway stations and property prices and created a regression plot for the two variables. The results showed a very weak negative correlation, suggesting that while properties closer to subway stations tend to have slightly higher prices, the effect is small. The majority of homes in the dataset were already located within one mile of a subway, which may explain the limited variation.

Next, we analyzed the relationship between property prices and proximity to parks. Using the NYC parks dataset, we calculated distances from each property to the nearest park, calculated the correlation coefficient between proximity to a park and property prices, and graphed the regression plot between the two. The results showed a weak negative correlation- prices decreased slightly as distance from the nearest park increased. Most properties were already located close to parks, so while proximity had some influence, it was not a strong predictor on its own.

To explore this further, we categorized properties based on the type of park nearby: waterfront, non-waterfront, or not near a park (using a 0.5-mile threshold). We did this by splitting the data into three categories, calculating the average price of each category, and creating a bar plot to represent the data. This provided a clearer picture of how park access relates to price differences. The results showed a significant contrast between the groups. Properties near parks were generally much more expensive than those not near any park, and non-waterfront park-adjacent homes were the most valuable (roughly twice as expensive as those near waterfront parks).

This finding was particularly interesting because one might expect waterfront areas to be the most desirable. However, the data suggest that non-waterfront parks may be located in more central or higher-demand residential areas, driving up property values. It’s also worth noting that there are far more non-waterfront parks than waterfront ones in the dataset, which could contribute to greater variability in these results.

## Conclusion:
Our analysis shows that New York City properties are shaped by both physical property characteristics and the surrounding environment. Housing prices change depending on the neighborhood, and their values also grow or decrease depending on that, conveying that the neighborhood one resides in plays a role in house value. Certain characteristics within various properties command higher listing prices. While the number of residential units and building type in a property play significant roles in property valuation, other features, such as gross square footage, do not show a strong correlation. Proximity to amenities, like the distance to subways and parks, can also have an effect on property prices in New York City. While subway proximity has little impact, homes near parks, particularly non-waterfront parks, tend to be significantly more valuable. Together, these findings highlight that neighborhood growth, property features, and proximity to various amenities interact to determine housing prices within New York City.
